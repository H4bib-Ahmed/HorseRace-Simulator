Horse Race Simulator:

Overview:

This Java project attempts to offer several interactive features, including racing tracks and lanes, in a dynamic simulation of a live horse race. Sunny McFarewell started the horse race simulation, 
which is currently being worked on by another developer. The project aims to provide both textual and graphical representations of a realistic and entertaining horse racing experience for users.

Tools and softwares:

• Java Development Kit (JDK): JDK 1.8 or later is needed to run Java programs, which is necessary to run this program.
Oracle's JDK website offers the most recent version of Java for download and installation.

• Operating System: This software is compatible and and can run on many operating systems such as windows, MacOS and Linux. But
make sure 'java' and 'javac' are in your systems path to compile and run the programs from the command line.

Features:

• each race is determined by the confidence rating of each horse so if a horse has a higher confidence rating it will move faster
but will have a higher chance of falling down. whilst a horse with lower confidence rating moves much slower but has a less likley
chance to fall down.

• A fallen horse will have their confidence lowered whilst a horse which has a won a race will have their cofidence increased. 

• Multiple features will be added such as letting the user change the track length. letting the user customize the horse for example, 
the name and symbol of the horse and the user can also change the colour of the race tracks background.
